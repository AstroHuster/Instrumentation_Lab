    "One problem with the above plot is that since the data is not smooth, it should be plotted with dots or symbols. Data should almost always be plotted with dots or symbols. `matplotlib`, like `Matlab`, does this with a formatting parameterin the `plot` command. You can append and optional third parameter after the y array with formatting information about the plot line. This formatting is a very compact string with the line type, the symbol, and the color encoded in a three character string. Here are some examples:\n",
    "* `'-k'` - plots only a black line. (`k` means blac***k***.)\n",
    "* `'.r'` - plots only dots in the color red\n",
    "* `'--g'` - plots only a green dashed line\n",
    "* `'ob'` - plots only circles in blue\n",
    "* `'^:m'` - plots triangle connected by a dotted line in magenta\n",
    "* `help(plt.plot)` is always available with more options and details\n",
