    "One of the most important concepts in good programming is to reuse code and avoid repetitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to write functions and classes with a well-defined purpose and scope, and reuse these instead of repeating similar code in different part of a program (modular programming). The result is usually that readability and maintainability of a program is greatly improved. What this means in practice is that our programs have fewer bugs, are easier to extend and debug/troubleshoot.\n",
    "\n",
    "These packages of reusable code are called *modules* in python. Other languages refer to them as *libraries* or *include* files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports modular programming at different levels. Functions and classes are examples of tools for low-level modular programming. Python modules are a higher-level modular programming construct, where we can collect related variables, functions and classes in a module. A python module is defined in a python file (with file-ending `.py`), and it can be made accessible to other Python modules and programs using the `import` statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example based on the previous homework: the file `mymodule.py` contains simple example implementations of a variable and a function. The curious line `%%file game.py` is a jupyter command (not a python command) that writes the code in the cell to the file `game.py`.\n",
