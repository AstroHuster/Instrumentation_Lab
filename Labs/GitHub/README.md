# AstroHuster GitHub Account

I set up a github account for the Observatory. I am also using it as a repository for the Instrumentation Lab.

- Navigate to github.com
- Sign in as astrohuster@gmail.com
- The password is `Einstein2323@#@#`
- If the password does not work try the token below.
- I set this account up to use a classic personal access token. The token should be entered as the password when logging in. It does not expire and has full access to the repository.
