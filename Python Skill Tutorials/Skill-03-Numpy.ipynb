    "One of the most important concepts in good programming is to reuse code and avoid repetitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to write functions and classes with a well-defined purpose and scope, and reuse these instead of repeating similar code in different part of a program (modular programming). The result is usually that readability and maintainability of a program is greatly improved. What this means in practice is that our programs have fewer bugs, are easier to extend and debug/troubleshoot.\n",
    "\n",
    "These packages of reusable code are called *modules* in python. Other languages refer to them as *libraries* or *include* files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports modular programming at different levels. Functions and classes are examples of tools for low-level modular programming. Python modules are a higher-level modular programming construct, where we can collect related variables, functions and classes in a module. A python module is defined in a python file (with file-ending `.py`), and it can be made accessible to other Python modules and programs using the `import` statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example based on the previous homework: the file `mymodule.py` contains simple example implementations of a variable and a function. The curious line `%%file game.py` is a jupyter command (not a python command) that writes the code in the cell to the file `game.py`.\n",

    "# Statistical Functions\n",
    "Once you have taken some data, the first business is to answer some basic statistical questions about the data. The most common are what is the min, max, and average. You also often want to know what is the standard deviation of the average is. `numpy` has functions to do these basic statistical calculations. The maximum and minimum functions are `np.max` and `np.min`; the average and standard deviation functions are `np.average` and `np.std`. The standard deviation of the average is standard deviation of the data divided by the number of points. (Remember the `len` function?)\n",

    "## Formating Strings\n",
    "Python has two ways of printing formatted numbers. I will just show the the older traditional method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another topic that can get tedious is how to format output, print, and strings. The simplest structure of a format string is something like `%f` where the `f` means format a `float`. Format strings also take one or more precision numbers. Here are example of some commonly used format strings:\n",
    "* \"%.2f\" - `float` with two decimal places\n",
    "* \"%6d\" - `int` or `long` printed in 6 spaces.\n",
    "* \"%.3e\" - `float` as an exponential with three decimal places, like \"3.142e0\" for pi.\n",
    "* %s - output a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Formatting Strings\n",
    "The way format strings work is that you input a formatting string to the `%` operator and have a second group of items to convert. The converted items replace the format string with their value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Huh? Here are some examples. Note the position of the `%` operator after the string and before the values to be formatted. Also note that I stronly encourage you to group your values in parentheses. First I define some variables with some values:\n",
    "```\n",
    "msg = \"Hello\"\n",
    "amp1 = 3.1415926\n",
    "amp2 = -2.71828\n",
    "nPts = 47\n",

    "|----|----|\n",
    "|\"You said %s\" % (msg) | \"You said Hello\" |\n",

    "| \"A small number is %.e\" %(1.0/1000000)|\"A small number is 1.0e-06\"|\n",
    "|\"There are %d points with a min of %.2f\" % (nPts, amp2)|\"There are 47 points with a min of -2.72\"|\n",
