This repository is for the maintaining of files and code for the 
instrumentation lab I wrote for Geneva College.

# Table of Contents
- **Code** - Contains some of the code used in the course. There are other Code directories in specific project directories.
- **Figures** - Most of the figures used in the lab and project documents. 
  There are sub-folders for individual labs and projects.
- **Labs** - This folder has all of the lab handouts. I use LibreOffice Writer to create all 
  of the documents and the PDF generator in Writer to make PDF files.
- **Projects** - I made two of the tasks "Projects", the Function Generator and the 
  Alpha Counter. The documents and files for those are in the Projects directory.
- **Python Skills Tutorials** - There are two versions of each tutorial. One with all 
  the answers and a Student version where the students have to figure out code.
- **UF2_files** - The version of MicroPython we used in the Fall 2024 course.
- Other miscellaneous files
  - Syllabus
  - PDF of 1st edition of text
  - Intro to Oscilliscope
  - Parts used. (This list is partial.)
